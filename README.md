#######

- pkill  -9  python =  it forcefully stops all running Python processes
- nohup python app.py = it keeps running even if your terminal is closed or you log out. (Normally, when you close your terminal or get disconnected (especially over SSH), running programs stop. 
  nohup prevents that.)
- nohup python app.py & = to run it in the background than add &
- netstat -plnt = This command lists network connections and listening ports on your system, showing useful details


# ansible-playbook  -i hosts  main.yml = testing playbook for playbook on vsc




####
NOTES..
2 rules while writing playbooks
- you cant automate something you dont know
- test one task at a time.
- create playbook before creating a role
